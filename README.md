# Real_time_object_detection

This is an implementation of a Real-Time Object detection API which identifies the classes of the objects in
video streaming using Tensorflow and OpenCV.

A Transfer Learning based Object Detection API that detects all objects in an image, video streaming via USB Camera.
An SSD model and a Faster R-CNN model was pretrained on Mobile Net COCO dataset along with a label
map in Tensorflow. These models were used to detect objects captured in an image, video or real time 
webcam. OpenCV was used for streaming objects and preprocessing.
